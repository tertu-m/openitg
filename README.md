# experimental OpenITG repo
This is an experimental OpenITG repo created for tertu's personal projects.

She does not provide any formal support for it and there will be no releases.
It should usually compile on x86_64 Linux, but may not always. 
Other platforms aren't intentionally broken but aren't being tested.

Feel free to take any code from it that you find useful, or to send any questions to tertu that you might have.

## Current additions
* Improved SuperShuffle implementation (done, I think)
* NoteDisplay optimizations (very WIP, there's some initial work on the ArrowEffects rewrite present)
* Improvements to random number generation (done for now)
